# Cine4u

A flutter project interacting with the Movies Database API.

## Getting Started

You first need flutter to be installed on your machine.

To install the packages needed, run:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

If "Chrome (web)" or "Edge (web)" doesn't appear in your list of devices, 
you need to enable web support. You can do this by enabling web support:
```bash
flutter config --enable-web
```

This command will run the App locally in a development version of Chrome.
Replace 'chrome' with 'edge' to run the app in Edge.
```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

Although not really necessary, you can generate the web pages with:
```bash
flutter build web
```
